# Gratitude City

Build your own city by being grateful! In this app you'll be filling up a gratitude journal. For every gratitude page written, you'll get a house into your own virtual city. This game-like structure helps to keep up the motivation for journaling and will plant more positivity into our lives.

We think that there's never enough of gratitude in this world.
We must actively practice it to cement its place in our lives.

Studies have shown that gratitude has the ability to shift our focus away from toxicity and helps us to change our mind for towarrd more positive. There are many benefits of gratitude journaling; from reducing stress levels to improved quality of sleep. The only difficulty is encouraging people to start and keep motivated about journaling.

Our app motivates to keep gratitude journal by creating a virtual house for every gratitude page written. The user gets to place each house on a street, eventually creating a city. The satisfaction of creating a thriving community will keep people coming back and journaling.

We believe that our solution is an effective way of getting many people to practice journaling and getting the benefits from that.
